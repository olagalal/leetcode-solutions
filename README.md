# Python, Java & C++ Solutions for Leetcode

Welcome to my **LeetCode Solutions** repository! 👩🏻‍💻

I'm actively solving problems to strengthen my algorithmic and coding skills in **Python**, **Java**, and **C++**. This repo contains solutions to various LeetCode problems, organized by difficulty and topic. Each problem is solved in multiple languages to help me deepen my understanding and improve my fluency in different programming languages.

## 📚 Study Plan
I'm following along with [NeetCode.io](https://neetcode.io/) to systematically go through the problems, learn different approaches, and improve my problem-solving abilities. You’ll find solutions, along with brief explanations and the core concepts used for each problem.

## 🚀 How To Use This Repo

- **Solutions by Language:** Navigate through the folders for Python, Java, and C++ to find solutions in each language.
- **Problem List:** Each problem is listed below with links to the solution in each language and a separate explanation file.
- **Explanations:** Brief explanations are provided for each problem, summarizing the approach used to solve it.

## 📝 Progress Tracker

This repository is not just a collection of problems but also a way for me to track my progress. I hope it helps others preparing for coding interviews or improving algorithmic thinking.
